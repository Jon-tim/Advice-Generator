## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the app depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Generate a new piece of advice by clicking the dice icon


## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Tailwind CSS
- Mobile-first workflow
- JavaScript

### What I learned

Use this section to recap over some of your major learnings while working through this project. Writing these out and providing code samples of areas you want to highlight is a great way to reinforce your own knowledge.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
```

```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  color: papayawhip;
}
```

```js
const proudOfThisFunc = () => {
  console.log("ðŸŽ‰");
};
```

If you want more help with writing markdown, I'ld recommend checking out [The Markdown Guide](https://www.markdownguide.org/) to learn more.

### Continued development

Hopefully, this became an app template for anyone to integrate into their web-apps/ websites

### Useful resources

- [TAILWIND CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/installation) - This is the amazing tailwind CSS docs which helped me fully understand Tailwind CSS. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept to start with rather than a tutorial.
